# ðŸ§¼ Data Cleaning & EDA: Customer Personality Analysis

This repository contains data cleaning and basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) for the **Customer Personality Analysis** dataset from Kaggle. This project is part of a Data Analyst Internship Task focused on handling real-world data quality issues.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview
The dataset contains marketing-related data about customer demographics, behaviors, and purchasing habits.

- Source: Kaggle
- Format: Tab-separated values
- Records: ~2,200 rows
- Features: Demographics, products purchased, campaign responses, etc.

## ðŸ§¹ What Was Done

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| âœ… Data Loading | Used `sep='\t'` to correctly parse the file |
| âœ… Column Renaming | Renamed all columns for clarity and consistency |
| âœ… Missing Values | Filled `income` nulls with the median |
| âœ… Duplicate Removal | Dropped duplicate records |
| âœ… Infinite Values | Converted `inf/-inf` to `NaN` and treated them |
| âœ… Standardization | Normalized text data (e.g., marital status) |
| âœ… Date Conversion | Converted `enrollment_date` to datetime |
| âœ… Derived Fields | Created `age`, `total_spent`, `kids_total`, etc. |
| âœ… Export | Saved cleaned data to `cleaned_marketing_campaign.csv` |

## ðŸ“ˆ EDA Highlights

- Most customers are aged 30â€“60
